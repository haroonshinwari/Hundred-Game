'''Haroon SHINWARI -
This is a simple die game, where the objective is to score 100 by rolling a die. The computer starts first, and at each turn,
the computer or player depending on whose turn it is, must decide to either roll or not roll. They acumulate a score of whatever
they roll in one turn and it is added to their score, unless they roll a 1 in which case their cumulative score for that turn is 0,
and it is the other players turn. If a player chooses not to roll, his cumulative score for that turn is added to his total score.

Whoever gets to 100 first wins, however as the computer starts first,it has an advantage and therefore if the computer reaches 100,
the other player is given another turn, and whomever scores highest wins, if they are tied, they keep rolling until one gets a higher score.
